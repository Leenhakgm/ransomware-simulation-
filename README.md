# 🛡️ Ransomware Simulation Project

This project simulates a basic ransomware attack for educational and awareness purposes. It helps users understand how ransomware can affect files and how system responses can be measured. The project also generates a detailed **PDF report** of the simulation.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a safe simulation designed strictly for cybersecurity education. It does not harm any files or perform any malicious actions.
